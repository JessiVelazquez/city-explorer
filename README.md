**Author**: Jessi Velazquez
**Version**: 1.2.0 

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This is an app developed for users who want to quickly view a map of a city of their choice. User inputs the city and retreives basic data, including a map of the city.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

03-24-2021 11:13pm - Application now pulls location and weather data from API and renders both on bootstrap card. Both front and back end are deployed to Netlify and Heroku, but deplopyed back end does not send weather data to front end. It works when nodemon is running for the server side.
